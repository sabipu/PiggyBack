## Overview

PiggyBack syncs with [Up Bank](https://up.com.au/) to automatically import your accounts and transactions, then provides tools to manage your finances. It features shared budgets with fair-split calculations, savings goal tracking linked to Up savers, recurring expense detection, investment portfolio tracking with live price updates from Yahoo Finance and CoinGecko, FIRE (Financial Independence) planning, and an AI-powered financial assistant.

Each user connects their own Up Bank account using a personal access token. All financial data is stored in the user's own Supabase database with row-level security -- no data is shared with third parties.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free tier works)
- An [Up Bank](https://up.com.au/) account (Australian neobank)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenLaurenson/PiggyBack.git
cd PiggyBack
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

Create a new Supabase project, then apply the database migrations in order:

```bash
# Apply all migrations from supabase/migrations/ via the Supabase dashboard SQL editor
# or using the Supabase CLI
```

The `supabase/migrations/` directory contains a single consolidated migration that sets up all tables, RLS policies, and functions.

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Required variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Supabase publishable key |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Your Supabase secret key (server-side only, Settings > API Keys) |
| `UP_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-character hex key for encrypting stored Up API tokens (see `.env.local.example`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Your app URL (`http://localhost:3005` for local dev, `http://localhost:3000` for Docker/production) |

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) to access the app. Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local` is set to `http://localhost:3005` and your Supabase auth redirect URLs include the `:3005` port.

### 5. Connect Up Bank

1. Sign up / log in to PiggyBack
2. Go to Settings > Up Bank Connection
3. Enter your Up Bank Personal Access Token (from the Up app or [api.up.com.au](https://api.up.com.au))
4. Your accounts and transactions will sync automatically

## Up Bank API Usage

This app uses the [Up Bank API](https://developer.up.com.au/) for personal banking data. Per Up's [API Acceptable Use Policy](https://up.com.au/api-acceptable-use-policy/):

- The API is for **personal use only**
- Each user must use their **own personal access token**
- Tokens must **not be shared** with third parties
- Do not extract merchant data for commercial use

Your Up API token is encrypted at rest in the database and is never exposed in client-side code.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test          # Watch mode
npm run test:run  # Single run
```

The test suite covers 1120+ tests across 50 test files, including:

- Budget calculations (zero-based, shared budgets, period helpers, income frequency)
- Investment logic (price APIs, portfolio aggregation, FIRE calculations, invest calculations)
- Expense projections and matching
- AI tool definitions

## Deployment

Two deployment guides are available:

- **[Deploy to the Cloud](DEPLOY-CLOUD.md)** — Vercel + hosted Supabase (free tier, quickest setup)
- **[Deploy Locally](DEPLOY-LOCAL.md)** — Docker + local or hosted Supabase (self-hosted, maximum privacy)

## Security

PiggyBack takes security seriously. The project maintains an [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/10407) passing badge and is continuously monitored by the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/BenLaurenson/PiggyBack).

### CI/CD Security Pipeline

Every push and pull request is scanned by:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| CodeQL | SAST for JS/TS — detects XSS, injection, data flow vulnerabilities |
| Trivy | Filesystem and Docker vulnerability scanning, SBOM generation |
| Gitleaks | Secret detection in commits (also runs as a pre-commit hook) |
| Dependency Review | Blocks PRs with vulnerable or restrictively-licensed dependencies |
| Snyk | Code and dependency scanning (SAST + SCA) |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | Automated supply chain security health scoring |
| SLSA Provenance | Supply chain integrity and artifact provenance verification |
| Dependabot | Automated dependency updates for npm, GitHub Actions, and Docker |

All workflow files are in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/).

### Application Security

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — Up Bank API tokens encrypted at rest
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** — All user-facing Supabase tables protected
- **HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification** — Timing-safe comparison for Up Bank webhooks
- **Zod input validation** — Schema validation on all server actions and API routes
- **Content Security Policy** — CSP headers configured in Next.js
- **GitHub Secret Scanning** — Push protection enabled to prevent credential leaks
